**General**

The Heart-Work-Culator app was established to simplify the generation of non-invasive left ventricular pressure-volume loops.

To carry out the analysis, parameters assessed through echocardiography and simultaneous blood pressure measurement are needed. As a result this app provides detailled efficiency parameters of the left ventricle.

Dominik Bitzer built the Heart-Work-Culator app in medical collaboration with Dr. Felix Oberhoffer as an Open Source app. A web-version of this calculation tool is available at https://www.heart-work-culator.org
